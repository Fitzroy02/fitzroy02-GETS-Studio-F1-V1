## 🌱 Ecological Impact Tracking

### Dual Methodology

**1. Currency-Based (from 10% allocation)**
- Trees bucket (6%): £1 = 0.1 trees planted
- Oceans bucket (4%): £1 = 0.05 restoration score

**2. Likes-Based (Music & Movies)**
- 10,000 likes = 1 tree planted
- Tracked separately from currency allocation
- Cumulative lifetime total

**3. Impression-Based (for campaigns)**
- Configured per content item
- E.g., 1,000 views = 0.5 trees, 0.3 ocean score

### Example Combined Impact (Monthly)

**Music Streaming (100 subscribers)**:
- Currency: £65.94 trees → 6.59 trees planted
- Currency: £43.96 oceans → 2.20 ocean score
- Likes: 50,000 total → 5 trees planted
- **Total: 11.59 trees, 2.20 ocean score**

**Movie Home Channel (£5,000 ad revenue)**:
- Currency: £300 trees → 30 trees planted
- Currency: £200 oceans → 10 ocean score
- Likes: 30,000 total → 3 trees planted
- **Total: 33 trees, 10 ocean score**

**Movie Channel (100 subscribers)**:
- Currency: £65.94 trees → 6.59 trees planted
- Currency: £43.96 oceans → 2.20 ocean score
- Likes: 25,000 total → 2.5 trees planted
- **Total: 9.09 trees, 2.20 ocean score**

**Grand Total Monthly Ecological Impact: 53.68 trees, 14.40 ocean score**
