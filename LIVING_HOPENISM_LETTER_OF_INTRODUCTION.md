## Subject: Contract Information Submission — Living Hopenism

Dear GitHub Team,

On behalf of **Living Hopenism**, I am pleased to submit our contract details for account setup and partnership registration. Our organization is committed to advancing ethical technology, creative stewardship, and ecological responsibility, and we look forward to working with GitHub to ensure our projects are managed with transparency and compliance.

We have enclosed our **Contract Information Sheet**, which includes our organizational details, website, and contact information. Bank details and registration numbers will follow securely through the appropriate channels once your secure portal access is confirmed.

### Our Mission

Our mission is to build platforms that unify creative output with ecological anchors, ensuring that every act of transmission — whether in books, music, podcasts, films, or clinical innovation — contributes to both cultural enrichment and environmental stewardship.

### What We Do

Living Hopenism operates the **GETS Studio F1** ecosystem, a comprehensive creative and clinical platform that includes:

**Creative Services:**
- Book publishing and distribution (15 legal deposit libraries)
- Music streaming and distribution (4 million+ tracks)

- Film classification and archival distribution (3 film archives)

**Medical Services:**
- Emotional Tone Device clinical service (NHS-compliant)
- Heart monitor integration for early intervention
- NHS Digital Security Standards compliance (DSPT Level 2, Cyber Essentials Plus)

**Ecological Stewardship:**
- 10% revenue allocation to trees and ocean conservation
- 13,957 trees planted to date
- £79,000 allocated to ocean protection
- Blockchain-verified ecological impact certificates

**Governance Framework:**
- 70/20/10 revenue split (contributors/platform/ecological)
- Transparent contributor governance with quarterly reporting
- Financial integrity and auditable blockchain verification
- GDPR and UK data protection compliance

### Why GitHub Partnership Matters

We rely on GitHub for:
- **Version control** for our platform codebase (GETS Studio F1)
- **Collaboration** with contributors and developers worldwide
- **Transparency** through open-source governance frameworks
- **Security** for sensitive medical device code (Emotional Tone Device)
- **Compliance** with NHS Digital security standards

Our repositories include documentation, compliance frameworks, contributor governance ledgers, and clinical service specifications — all managed with the same ethical rigor we bring to our creative and medical work.

### Our Commitment to GitHub

We commit to:
- ✅ Maintaining accurate and up-to-date account information
- ✅ Complying with GitHub's Terms of Service and Acceptable Use Policy
- ✅ Promptly addressing any compliance or security concerns
- ✅ Using GitHub responsibly for ethical technology development

### Next Steps

We kindly request:
1. **Account activation** for Living Hopenism under our organizational name
2. **Secure portal access** for transmitting bank details and registration documents
3. **Compliance verification** if required for medical device code repositories
4. **Partnership contact** for ongoing support and technical queries
