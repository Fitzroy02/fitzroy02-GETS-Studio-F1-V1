### 2.5 Eco-Points System

**1. Eco-Points Calculation**

**2. Calculation Example**  
2.1 Example: £1,250 sale → £125 ecological allocation (10%) → 125 eco-points → Artist credited with contribution to planting 12 trees (60% of £125 = £75 ÷ £10/tree = 7.5 rounded to 8 trees)

**3. Engagement-Based Eco-Points**  
3.1 **10,000 likes/favorites = 1 additional tree planted** (funded by platform ecological allocation)  
3.2 Likes counted cumulatively across artist's entire portfolio  
3.3 Engagement trees credited quarterly and noted in artist's eco certificate

**4. Eco-Points Tracking & Visibility**

5.4 Available as PDF download or shareable digital certificate

6.1 60% to reforestation (£10 = 1 native tree: oak, birch, rowan, pine)  
6.2 40% to ocean conservation (plastic removal, coral restoration, coastal cleanup)  
6.3 Tree planting partners: Woodland Trust, Trees for Life, National Forest Company
