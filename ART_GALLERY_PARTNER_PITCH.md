## 🌳 Ecological Stewardship: Every Sale Plants Trees

**10% of All Sales → Permanent Ecological Allocation**

**Breakdown:**
- **60% to Reforestation (£70.56 from £117.60 example):**
  - **£10 = 1 native tree planted**
  - Example: £1,200 sale → 7 trees (oak, birch, rowan, Scots pine, hazel)
  - **Planting partners:** Woodland Trust, Trees for Life, National Forest Company, One Tree Planted
  - **CO₂ offset:** 0.1 tonnes per tree over 10-year lifespan (7 trees = 0.7 tonnes CO₂)

- **40% to Ocean Conservation (£47.04 from £117.60 example):**
  - **Distributed to:** Ocean Cleanup (plastic removal), Surfers Against Sewage (UK coastal cleanup), Marine Conservation Society (coral restoration)
  - **Projects:** Plastic collection, beach cleanups, coral nurseries, marine protected areas

**Transparency & Verification:**
- ✅ **Quarterly tree planting** with GPS coordinates, species documentation, photos
- ✅ **Blockchain verification** (SHA-256 hash on Ethereum)
- ✅ **Third-party audits** (annual independent environmental assessment)
- ✅ **Public reporting** (quarterly certificates to artists, annual platform-wide impact report)
- ✅ **Artist recognition** (eco leaderboard, badges: Seedling → Grove Grower → Forest Builder → Eco Champion)

**Eco-Points System:**
- Artists earn **eco-points = 10% of sale value**
- **1,000 eco-points = 1 tree planted**
- Tracked in artist profile, displayed publicly on gallery page
- **10,000 likes/favorites = 1 engagement tree** (platform-funded, bonus)

**Example Impact (Artist's First Year):**
- 20 artworks sold at average £800 each = £16,000 total sales
- Artist earns: £11,180 (70% of £15,968 after admin fees)
- Trees planted: **160 trees** (16 tonnes CO₂ offset over 10 years)
- Ocean conservation: £640 contributed
- Quarterly certificates documenting exact tree locations and species

## 🛡️ Buyer Protection: 7-Day Viewing Period

**Traditional Auction Houses:**
- Returns rare (often requires legal action)
- "All sales final" policy common
- Authenticity disputes take months to resolve
- Buyer bears all risk

**GETS Studio F1:**
- ✅ **7-day viewing period** from delivery date
- ✅ **Refund eligibility:** Not as described, damaged in shipping, authenticity issue, condition issue
- ✅ **48-hour processing** after item returned and platform notified
- ✅ **Non-refundable:** Delivery costs (buyer bears shipping risk), buyer's remorse
- ✅ **Ecological allocation permanent** (trees planted even if sale refunded)
- ✅ **Fair mediation** (platform reviews requests, artist can provide defense)
- ✅ **Transparent process** (documented with buyer and seller confirmation forms)

**Why This Matters:**
- Builds buyer confidence (reduces purchase anxiety)
- Protects artists from fraudulent claims (verification required)
- Balances fairness (legitimate issues refunded, frivolous claims denied)
- Maintains ecological commitment (refunds don't reverse environmental impact)
