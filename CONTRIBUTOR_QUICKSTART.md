## 3. 💵 How You're Paid

### Music & Mixtape Streaming

**Revenue Model:** Subscription-based (£10.99/month)

**Your Share:** 70% of subscription revenue distributed by stream count

**Calculation:**
```
Your Monthly Payout = (Your Streams / Total Platform Streams) × Contributor Pool

Example:
- Platform has 500,000 total streams
- Your tracks earned 10,000 streams (2%)
- Contributor pool is £7,693
- Your payout: (10,000 / 500,000) × £7,693 = £153.86
```

**Payment Schedule:** Monthly via direct deposit/PayPal

### Podcast Streaming

**Revenue Model:** Included in music subscription

**Your Share:** 70% of allocated revenue, paid per stream

**Community Stations:** Earn tokens from ad revenue (10% share = tokens redeemable for hosting, equipment, airtime)

### Movie Streaming

**Home Channel (Free Tier):**
- Revenue: Ad-supported (30-second ads, max 3 per session)
- Your share: 60% of ad revenue
- Payment: Per view

**Movie Channel (Paid Subscription):**
- Revenue: £10.99/month subscription
- Your share: 70% of subscription revenue
- Payment: Per stream
- Bonus: Higher payout percentage than free tier

---

## 4. 🌱 Ecological Anchors

### Automatic Ecological Contribution

**10% of all revenue** (ads + subscriptions) automatically funds:
- **Trees**: 6% → tree planting projects
- **Oceans**: 4% → ocean conservation

**You don't pay this** — it comes from platform revenue before distribution.

### Likes → Trees Conversion

**Formula: 10,000 likes = 1 tree planted**

| Your Content Likes | Trees Planted |
|-------------------|---------------|
| 2,500 | 0.25 trees |
| 10,000 | 1 tree |
| 25,000 | 2.5 trees |
| 100,000 | 10 trees |

**Example:**
- Track A: 15,000 likes → 1.5 trees
- Mixtape B: 8,000 likes → 0.8 trees
- Podcast C: 12,000 likes → 1.2 trees
- **Your total impact: 3.5 trees planted from likes alone**

### Combined Impact Tracking

Every month, you'll see:
- **Currency-based impact**: From your revenue share (£1 = 0.1 trees)
- **Likes-based impact**: From community engagement (10K likes = 1 tree)
- **Total ecological contribution**: Trees + ocean restoration score

## 10. ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: Can I upload the same content to other platforms?
**A:** No. GETS Studio requires exclusive content. Uploading material from Spotify, YouTube, SoundCloud, or other platforms violates our content policy and will result in removal.

### Q: Is explicit music allowed?
**A:** Yes. Explicit music is fully allowed and receives the same payout structure, ecological impact, and treatment as all other content. Just mark it as explicit during upload.

### Q: How long before I get paid?
**A:** Payouts are processed monthly, typically around the 1st of each month for the previous month's streams.

### Q: What if my content gets zero streams?
**A:** No streams = no payout for that month. However, your content remains available and can earn in future months. Consider promoting, improving metadata/tags, or creating content aligned with civic/impact themes for priority placement.

### Q: Can I see who likes my content?
**A:** Aggregate like counts are visible. Individual user data is not shared to protect privacy.

### Q: How are community tokens different from cash?
**A:** Tokens are redeemable for platform services (hosting, equipment, airtime) but cannot be converted directly to cash. They're designed to support community stations with resources rather than cash payouts.

### Q: Do I control the ads on my content?
**A:** Ads only appear on Movie Home Channel (free tier). They are internally controlled and civic-aligned — no commercial radio ads. Music/podcast subscriptions and Movie Channel premium are ad-free.

### Q: Can I delete my content after uploading?
**A:** Yes, via your contributor dashboard. Note that past streams/likes will still count toward your lifetime ecological impact, but you won't earn new streams after deletion.

### Q: What happens to the ecological anchors?
**A:** 10% of all revenue is automatically allocated to tree planting and ocean conservation projects. You'll see transparent reporting on where funds go, including partner organizations and impact metrics.

### Q: Can I collaborate with other contributors?
**A:** Yes! Add collaborators in the metadata during upload. Payouts are split according to percentages you specify. Collaborative content often performs better due to combined audiences.
