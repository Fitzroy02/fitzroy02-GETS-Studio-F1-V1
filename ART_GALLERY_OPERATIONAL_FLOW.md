**Timeline:** 7 days from viewing/delivery confirmation (to request refund) + 48 hours after item return and platform notification (for refund processing)

**Actions:**

**Viewing Period Begins:**
1. **"Date of viewing"** defined as:
   - **Physical delivery:** Date buyer receives and unwraps artwork (tracked delivery confirmation or buyer's written acknowledgment)
   - **Digital delivery:** Date buyer downloads high-resolution file
   - **In-person pickup:** Date buyer collects artwork and confirms receipt

2. 7-day countdown starts from viewing date
3. Buyer has right to inspect artwork and compare to listing description

**Refund Eligibility:**
Buyer may request refund if:
- Artwork significantly differs from description (color, size, condition)
- Artwork damaged during shipping (must be documented with photos within 48 hours of delivery)
- Authenticity concerns (artwork not created by listed artist)
- Quality issues not disclosed in listing (tears, stains, structural damage)

**Non-Refundable Reasons:**
- Buyer dissatisfaction unrelated to description accuracy (e.g., "changed my mind," "doesn't match my decor")
- Buyer's remorse or change of taste
- Damage caused by buyer after delivery

**Refund Request Process:**
1. Buyer contacts platform support within 7-day viewing period:
   - Email: buyers@getsstudio.com
   - Subject: "Refund Request — Artwork [Reference Number]"
   - Include reason and photographic evidence (if applicable)

2. Platform reviews request within 48 hours:

   - Contacts artist for response/evidence/defense
   - Makes decision based on Terms & Conditions

3. **If refund approved:**

   - Full purchase price refunded to buyer's original payment method (final bid + admin fee)
   - **Delivery costs non-refundable** (buyer bears original and return shipping costs)

4. **If refund denied:**
   - Platform provides detailed explanation citing Terms & Conditions
   - Buyer may appeal decision within 7 days (senior management review)

---

### **STEP 7: Eco-Points Allocation & Ecological Impact**

**Timeline:** Immediate calculation, quarterly tree planting, annual reporting

**Actions:**

**Immediate Eco-Points Calculation:**
1. At sale completion, platform automatically calculates eco-points:
   - **Eco-points = 10% of final sale value** (the ecological allocation amount)
   - Example: £1,200 final bid → £120 ecological allocation → **120 eco-points**

2. Conversion rate:
   - **1,000 eco-points = 1 tree planted**
   - Example: 120 eco-points → 0.12 trees (accumulates toward 1 full tree at 1,000 points)

3. Eco-points credited to artist's profile:
   - Real-time update in artist dashboard
   - Public display on artist's gallery page: "This artist has planted 47 trees through sales"
   - Cumulative total tracked across all artwork sales

**Ecological Allocation Breakdown:**
1. **60% to Reforestation (£70.56 from £117.60 example):**
   - **£10 = 1 native tree planted**
   - Example: £70.56 → 7 trees (rounded down from 7.056)
   - **Tree species:** Oak, birch, rowan, Scots pine, hazel, willow (native UK); region-appropriate species for international projects
   - **Planting partners:** Woodland Trust, Trees for Life, National Forest Company, One Tree Planted
   - **Locations:** Scotland, Wales, Northern England, Cornwall (UK); international reforestation zones (where applicable)
   - **CO₂ offset:** 0.1 tonnes per tree over 10-year lifespan (7 trees = 0.7 tonnes CO₂)

2. **40% to Ocean Conservation (£47.04 from £117.60 example):**
   - **Funds distributed to:** Ocean Cleanup (plastic removal from Pacific Garbage Patch), Surfers Against Sewage (UK coastal cleanup), Marine Conservation Society (coral restoration, marine protected areas)
   - **Projects supported:**
     - Plastic collection operations
     - Beach and coastal cleanups
     - Coral nursery programs
     - Marine protected area enforcement
     - Ocean acidification research

**Quarterly Tree Planting:**
1. Platform accumulates ecological allocation funds quarterly (Jan-Mar, Apr-Jun, Jul-Sep, Oct-Dec)
2. At end of each quarter, trees planted in batch:
   - Coordinates with planting partners (Woodland Trust, Trees for Life, etc.)
   - Tree planting locations documented (GPS coordinates, species, date)
   - Photographs taken and shared with artists and buyers

3. Quarterly Eco Impact Certificates issued to all artists:
   - **Certificate ID:** `ECO-IMP-YYYYMMDD-####`
   - **Contents:**

     - Total artwork sales this quarter (number and value)
     - Eco-points earned this quarter
     - Trees planted this quarter (from artist's sales)
     - Ocean conservation contribution this quarter
     - Cumulative impact to date (total trees, total CO₂ offset)
     - Blockchain verification (SHA-256 hash)
     - Tree planting locations and species
     - Ocean projects supported

4. Certificate delivery:
   - PDF download via artist dashboard
   - Email notification with shareable digital certificate
   - Artist can display certificate on portfolio, social media, website

**Engagement-Based Eco-Points (Platform-Wide):**
1. **10,000 likes/favorites = 1 tree planted** (funded by platform's operational allocation)
2. Likes counted cumulatively across entire platform (all artworks, all artists)
3. Quarterly tallies and planting campaigns:
   - Example: "This quarter, 250,000 likes across the platform = 25 engagement trees planted!"
4. Engagement trees credited to platform-wide total (not individual artists)

**Annual Ecological Impact Report:**
1. Published each January covering previous calendar year
2. **Contents:**
   - Total artwork sales platform-wide (number and value)
   - Total eco-points earned by all artists
   - Total trees planted (from sales + engagement)

3. **Public accountability:** Quarterly and annual reports published openly (anyone can verify platform's ecological claims)
4. **Partner confirmation:** Tree planting partners (Woodland Trust, etc.) provide official confirmation of tree numbers, locations, species

**Artist Recognition:**
1. **Eco Leaderboard:** Top artists ranked by trees planted (displayed on platform homepage)
   - Example: "Top 5 Eco Artists: 1. Sarah Mitchell (487 trees), 2. David Chen (356 trees), 3. Emma Rodriguez (289 trees)..."
2. **Eco Badges:** Artists earn badges for milestones:
   - 🌱 10 trees: "Seedling"
   - 🌳 50 trees: "Grove Grower"
   - 🌲 100 trees: "Forest Builder"
   - 🌴 500 trees: "Eco Champion"
